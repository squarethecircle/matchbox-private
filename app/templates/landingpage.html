      			Matchbox lets you make matches and receive the matches other users have made!
                        <br><br>
                        Using facebook, our app generates a pair of your friends, who go to Yale, and allows you to endorse the match or not. Think of these matches in terms of how compatible their personalities are. To give the match a thumbs up, tap the up arrow key. To pass on it, tap the down arrow key. 
      			<br><br>
      			Our app also lets you chat with the Yale students other users have matched you with. The chats start out completely anonymous and it is completely up to you when/if you want to reveal your identity.
      			<br><br>
      			If you have any comments or suggestions for the game, please contact our team at <a href="mailto:team@matchboxapp.me">team@matchboxapp.me</a>.  We're looking forward to hearing from you!
